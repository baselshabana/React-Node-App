# Please take a minute to read this file

Kindly note that this is not the final version of the project. However, because of time limitation, this is the outcome of my work so far. It was a hard week for me, so I did not have so much time to work on this project.

#what's done:

-connectetivity establishment

-calling "https://oaosman84.github.io/statics/mock_transaction_data" and parsing the response

-creating (fully functional and tested) 5 api's:
getTotal, 
getPercentage, 
getJan2029, 
showList, 
markTransaction 

-creating 5 buttons and listeners to call the api's from the client

-client sends requests to the server and receive response successfully without catching any errors

#what's NOT done:

-displaying the response recieved from the server to the user in React components

-revamping for the frontend and UX

-adding unit testig scenarios
