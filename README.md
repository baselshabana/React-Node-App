Kindly note that this is not the final version of the project. However, because of time limitation, this is the outcome of my work so far. It was a hard week for me, so I did not have so much time to work on this project.

#what's done:

-connectetivity establishment

-calling "https://oaosman84.github.io/statics/mock_transaction_data" and parsing the response

-creating (fully functional and tested) 5 api's:
getTotal, 
getPercentage, 
getJan2029, 
getList, 
markCompany

-creating 5 buttons and listeners to call the api's from the client

-client sends requests to the server and receive response successfully without catching any errors

#what's NOT done:

-displaying the response recieved from the server to the user in React components

-revamping for the frontend and UX
